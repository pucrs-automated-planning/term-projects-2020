# Katherine Bianchini Esper

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](esper-proposal.pdf)
- [Presentation Slides](esper-presentation.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] It would have been better if you at least hinted at how you would derive the planning domain 
- [ ] Cite our previous work on Planning and fMRI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13742-016-0147-0-s

Stylistic comments:

- [ ] Write in the active voice and in the present tense unless you have a very good reason not to 
- [ ] Use language tool or grammarly to check the English so it looks more native 

## Part 2
